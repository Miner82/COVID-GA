A look at forecast error and lag times for 7-day moving average cases
COVID has, to use a bad metaphor, been analysed to death by the data analytics community.    I chose to look at two things:
14 days of a 7-day moving average, forecasted from case reports vs the next time cycle (two weeks) actuals.    We hope to be able to see the forecast compared to actuals for the same time period, measuring % error.   The seven day moving average was chosen rather than daily cases, due to weekend dips in reporting, and a measurable 7-8 day lag in lab processing.

Secondly, we want to see if signiture events of large gatherings of people (Black Lives Matter/anti-police protests, July 4 or Memorial Day outings, etc) would cause spikes 12-15 days out, the latent incubation period for the virus.
