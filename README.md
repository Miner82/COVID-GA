# COVID-GA
A look at forecast error and lag times for 7-day moving average cases.
COVID has, to use a bad metaphor, been analysed to death by the data analytics community.    I chose to look at two things:
Lagging 14 days of a 7-day moving average, forecasted from case reports vs the next time cycle's (two week's) actuals.    We hope to be able to see the forecast compared to actuals for the same time period, then measure % error.  The rumor is that the forecast methodology was adjusted by the state of Georgia Department of Health after repeated data reporting failures.
The seven day moving average was chosen due to weekend dips in reporting, and a measurable 7-8 day lag in lab processing.

Secondly, we want to prove or disprove that signiture events of large gatherings of people (Black Lives Matter/anti-police protests, July 4 or Memorial Day outings, etc) would cause spikes 12-15 days out, the latent incubation period for the virus.
