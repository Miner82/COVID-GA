  A look at forecast error and lag times for 7-day moving average cases.
COVID has, to use a bad metaphor, been analysed to death by the data analytics community.    I chose to look at two things:
Lagging 14 days of a 7-day moving average, forecasted from case reports vs the next time cycle's (two week's) actuals.    We hope to be able to see the forecast compared to actuals for the same time period, then measure % error.  The rumor is that the forecast methodology was adjusted by the state of Georgia Department of Health after repeated data reporting failures.
  The seven day moving average was chosen due to weekend dips in reporting, and a measurable 7-8 day lag in lab processing.

  Secondly, we want to prove or disprove that signiture events of large gatherings of people (Black Lives Matter/anti-police protests, July 4 or Memorial Day outings, etc) would cause spikes 12-15 days out, the latent incubation period for the virus.
  The data analysis does show two interesting findings: increases in case incidence about 2 weeks after major gatherings; ie Black Lives Matter/Police protests, 4th of July, Memorial day, and Labor Day.    These are definitely showing the effects of lack of distancing procedure.    The second finding shows forecast error (based on lagging 14 days of 7-day moving averages vs the actuals) all over the place in June-early August.    The Ga Dept of Health just did not seem to be able to forecast cases with any degree of confidence; forecast errors swung from -40% to +40% (see attached graphs for details).      Sometime around Aug 1 the forecast vs. following 14 day actuals has calmed down.
    In my opinion, the methodology has changed; forecasted 7-day averages vs their actuals track to within 0%-1% error.    We will have to make a call to the helpful people at the 
Ga Dept of Health....it requires explanation.
